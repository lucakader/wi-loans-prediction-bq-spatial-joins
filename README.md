Studied the geography of loans in Wisconsin using BigQuery and predicted loan amounts by combining public datasets, the HDMA loans dataset, and data from Google Form submissions. Integrated live Google Sheets data into BigQuery, performed spatial joins to associate loan data with Wisconsin counties, and developed a machine learning model for loan amount predictions based on income and loan term. Key tasks included querying and analyzing data from various sources, training models directly in BigQuery, and visualizing results to gain insights into loan patterns and geography.
